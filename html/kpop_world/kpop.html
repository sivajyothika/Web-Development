                <p>
                    Originally, Korean popular music evolved into K-pop, which is South Koreaâ€™s mainstream form of music. 
                    Korean pop music in the country could be considered similar to Taylor Swift in the United States.
                    Various ways to refer to Korean pop may include K-pop, K-pop, Kpop, K-Pop, or K-POP.

                <h2><i>What is Kpop music?</i></h2>
                <p>
                    The term K-pop includes many different musical elements and genres under its umbrella. 
                    Along with Korean pop, it can also include Korean rock music, hip hop, and electronic music. 
                    K-pop is considered a fairly new form of music. The type of K-Pop music that youâ€™re listening to today was formed around the 1990s.
                    The roots of K-pop began in the 1950s, however, and have since then already been influenced a lot by different types of Western music and pop groups. 
                    American pop music culture has especially had â€“ and still does have â€“ an effect on K-Pop.
